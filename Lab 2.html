          <p> question1a). the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used for a complex real time system is the water fall model. This is because the waterfall model is the tradional and sequential method since it helps to understand the history  and structure of waterfall  to better understand the flexibility of more modern methodologies</p>
          
          <p> question1b). Here as well, the water fall model is the most approraite generic software process for the webdite of a local library. which is because, it supports functions such as, issues, return the very basic function of searching for a particular book,and it also maintain data about books, teacher, stidents, and records that are required during various library operations</p>
          
          <p> question1c). The scrum is the most appropriate generic software process model that might be used in the development of  An order processing system with a web-site for a local business because, the scrum model is built on the assumption that,the development  requirements could and should be changed during the process</p>
               
               <p>question2) Advantages and disadvantages of the waterfall model.</p>
         
                  A) advantages</p>
                  <p>*before the next phase of the development each phase must be completed</p>
                  <p>*it is suited for smaller projects where requirements are well defined</p>
                  
                  <p>B)disadvantages
                  <p>* Erros can befoxed only during the 
                  phase </p> 
                  <p>*It is not desirable for complex projects where requirements changes frequently.</p>
