       <h2> write down the roblem statement for a suggested systemof relevance</h2>
       <p> A soft ware should be developed for the specialty of Ecommerce and Digital Marketing of the attendance list for the accademic year 2021/2022. The system should be independent from others in nature, which should be designed with emphasises laid on security, with a simple and coherent user interface which would ease the administrators in charge know the number of students whom are always present in classes and those whom are not always present. This is because, with the manual attendant list submitted at the end of each course, students often tend to include the names of their class mate whom are not present in class in the list. which would be difficult for the administration to know exactly the actual number of students whom are always present in class.</p>
