          </h1> INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</h>
          <h2> Assignment1</h2>
          <p> question1,). yes software engineering is a part of system engineering process. This is because,software engineering is not only an important part of the system engineering, it is also relevant because it helps to shape the architectural design and development of the software system. At thesame time, software engineeringis not  an intergral part of the existing system engineering processessuch as, object management.</p>
          <p> question2,). software crisis is a term used in computer science because of the difficulty of wrtting useful and efficient computer programs in the required time</p>
          <p>question3).  softwear engineers are proffessionally responsible in the following ways; 
          </center>
          * writing well designed, testable and efficient code.
          * Building reussble components and libraries for the future.</center>
          <p>qusstion4).  yes, component base software engineering allows delivery. It does so because it usese previously tested components which permits it  to produce more reliable system at a faster rate</p>
